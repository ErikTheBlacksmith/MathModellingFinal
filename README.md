# MathModellingFinal
 An agent based predator prey simulation


This project was created for my math227 final, in addition to having a report and a presentation not included here. 

Initially, a model with immutable agents was used (folder oldModel), but when that ran into problems, I switched to having mutable agents (folder newModel).

newModel/visualizing.ipynb and newModel/analysis.ipynb contain all of the stuff that's cool to look at (gifs, and graphs used in previously mentioned supplemental work).
